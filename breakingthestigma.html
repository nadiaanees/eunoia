 <h3><strong>How Can We Break The Stigma?</strong></h3>
 <br>
   <div class = "breakingTheStigmaText">

  	What’s the first word that comes to mind when someone mentions mental illness? Most people would say “sick”, “retarded”, “dangerous”, or other derogatory words. Awareness of mental health has increased in recent years yet we still label it with this stigmatization. People with mental illnesses can feel ashamed of their illness and believe it is their own failure. This leads to the majority of mentally ill people to avoid seeking treatment. They suffer silently, in fear of society’s reaction to them.
    <p>
  	We need to change and support the mental health community and treat them as they are: human beings, just like everyone else. In this article, we discuss ways that can and will break the stigma around mental illness if enough people learn of them.
    <p>

  <strong>Break the Stereotype</strong>
  <br>
  People with mental illness can prosper and be successful. They can have a family and friends and pursue happiness. “It is also good for people to know that we also are 'survivors', that we also have 'days of recovery'; that we are not always 'ill'. That our symptoms can be managed like the symptoms of many other chronic illnesses (Psychology Today).”
  <p>

  <strong>Learn and Educate</strong>
  <br>
  	Educate yourself about different mental disorders and mental health in general. Research or ask professionals, and then enlighten those around you. If you have a mental illness and are comfortable talking about it, teach others about your illness and your hardships. When we don’t understand something, we tend to make assumptions and we carry those assumptions with us and spread them. We need to avoid making assumptions and spread the truth about mental health.
<p>
  <strong>All Illnesses are of Equal Importance</strong>
  <br>
  	When we hear about someone who has cancer, diabetes, or a heart attack we sympathize with them. We understand that they are battling something dangerous and support them. The same must be done for people battling mental illnesses. They are also battling something they have no control over and they need to be treated as people who are facing a threatening disease.
<p>
  <strong>Talk and Support</strong>
  <br>
  Talk to people around you who have mental illnesses. Learn more about their illness, symptoms, triggers, and anything else necessary. Support them, especially when they are going through hardships. Especially if you have a loved one who struggles from mental illness, the journey may be difficult but it is rewarding and helpful to be there for them.
<p>
  <strong>Be Careful with Language</strong>
  <br>
  Be aware of how you speak about mental illness. Don’t brush it off and don’t blame someone for their illness, it is not their fault and it is not something they can control. Similarly, don’t mock others for their disorder or use their illness as a joke. Being careless of your language could trigger or worsen the symptoms of a person with a mental illness. Avoid harsh and insensitive language, but also be wary of language that could come off as over sympathetic.
<p>
  <strong>Become an Advocate for Mental Health</strong>
  <br>
  	Support organizations that help the mental health community such as, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). Support friends or family with mental illnesses. Speak about mental health, whether it be online or at home. If you come across people talking badly about mental illnesses or people with them, whether it is your family, friends, coworkers or classmates, do not be afraid to correct them.

  "At the root of this dilemma is the way we view mental health in this country. Whether an illness affects your heart, your leg or your brain, it's still an illness, and there should be no distinction. -Michelle Obama"
