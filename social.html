         <p>What is emotional self-care? There are various definitions but in simple terms, emotional self-care is recognizing your thoughts and feelings and respectfully caring for them and your emotions. Emotional self-care is crucial for good overall self-care. Ignoring and burying your emotions can lead to burnout and breakdowns. Getting in touch with and understanding your thoughts and feelings can help you create a healthy relationship with your emotions and yourself.</p>
         <p>Here are some techniques to practice emotional self-care:</p>

         <ul>
           <li>When you need to, take a step back and take deep breaths. Take a moment to think about how you wish to express yourself.</li>
          <li>Identify your emotions, especially during stressful or emotional moments. Once you understand what causes or triggers those emotions learn to respond to them in safe and healthy ways.</li>
           <li>Learn to say no to others and donâ€™t feel guilty for putting yourself first. Listen to what you need and say yes to yourself. </li>
           <li>Talk about your feelings to people you trust.</li>
           <li>Reflect or meditate to become aware of your emotions, even if only for 5 minutes.</li>
           <li>Give to others, whether it be a smile, a compliment, or anything else. Be kind and put love into what you give.</li>
           <li>Accept what others give you without pushing back. For example, say thank you instead of dismissing compliments.</li>
           <li>Understand that you will make mistakes and nobody is perfect.</li>
           <li>Have boundaries for yourself and others.</li>
           <li>Ask for help and support from professionals.</li>
           <li>Accept yourself and who you are.</li>

         </ul>

  <p> What is social self-care? Social self-care is connecting with others to maintain your health. It means being aware that you are not alone and having people who you can rely on. Having people who listen to you when you need to talk can lead to a healthy and calm mind.It also means remembering that others have gone through the same difficulties as you. Your friends, family, and even strangers are some examples of a social network. There are four types of social self-support: emotional, tangible, esteem, and informational. Emotional support is where you feel loved and cared for. Tangible support is where others take your responsibilities so that you can focus on the important problem. Esteem support is where others express that they believe in you. Informational support is where others give advice to you and share information with you.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of social self care activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Going on a lunch date with a good friend.</li>
<li>Volunteering.</li>
<li>Calling a friend on the phone.</li>
<li>Participating in a book club.</li>
<li>Attending church.</li>
<li>Joining a support group.</li>
<li>Take up a sport or join a gym.</li>
<li>Use social networking sites.</li>
<li>Meeting with neighbors or coworkers.</li>

</ul>
