    <h2>our purpose</h2>
   <h5>Mental illnesses and mental disorders are one of the leading causes of poor health across the world. According to the World Health Organization, “One in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives. Around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions….Treatments are available, but nearly two-thirds of people with a known mental disorder never seek help from a health professional.” Why? The mental illness stigma has led people to believe that people with mental illnesses are dangerous, crazy, or dumb. Stereotypes and prejudices have taught us to believe that people with mental illnesses do not fit into society, they are not normal and the illness is their fault. None of this is true. When people do not understand something they become afraid or wary of it. Our purpose is to break the stigmatization of mental illnesses, inform people of some of the most common mental illnesses, and how to help people who are mentally ill.

   <h3>Nadia Anees is a rising senior at Fremont High School in Sunnyvale, CA.She wanted to attend Girls Who Code because of her interest in programming, design, and the environment of world-renowned companies such as Amazon. Girls Who Code provided her with many amazing opportunities to connect with skilled employees of top tech companies, who have solidified her decision to pursue a career in Computer Science and UI/UX Design. Throughout the program, she learned much more than just topics related to Computer Science- she learned that being a female is not a should not be treated as a barrier in the workplace, and that with enough hard work and dedication, anything is possible. In her free time, you can find Nadia in the gym or on the track, in any local coffee shop or in the kitchen making some extravagant sweet treat.
